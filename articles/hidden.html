       <h1>Hidden Password</h1> 
       <h2>Using symbolic execution to solve an interesting reverse engineering challenge</h2>
       <p>I recently was introduced to <a href="https://crackmes.one">crackmes.one</a> by a coworker. This is a writeup of pjenik's hidden_password challenge. As you will see, it is a great problem to tackle with angr.</p>
       <p>The challenge provides us with a hidden_password binary. To start off I performed some basic checks.</p>
       <pre><code>
[michael@pwn ~/Pwn/CrackMes]$ file hidden_password 
hidden_password: ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, BuildID[sha1]=8064a21b129bd27bbcc843f635aae01b7b154a2a, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, stripped
[michael@pwn ~/Pwn/CrackMes]$ checksec --file=hidden_password 
RELRO           STACK CANARY      NX            PIE             RPATH      RUNPATH      Symbols         FORTIFY Fortified       Fortifiable     FILE

       </code></pre>
       <p>So we have a 64-bit ELF executable with an executable stack. This will come into play later. Next I loaded the binary into Ghidra. In Ghidra we can see some interesting data being loaded on the stack, and some sort of checksum being calculated. </p>

       <!--IMG 1-->
       <img src="img/hidden-code-block-1.png" alt="">
       <p>Next, the binary stores our "checksum" and uses it to seed a number generator to XOR against that stack data from the beginning. After that it calculates another checksum before executing the decoded shellcode on the stack. Ouch!</p>

       <!--IMG 2-->
       <img src="img/hidden-code-block-2.png" alt="">
       <p>My first instinct was to do some math, but then I decided to try out the angr library. To avoid complications, I used the pre-built docker image. Getting up and running is as simple as running the following two commands!</p>

       <pre><code>
$ docker pull angr/angr
$ docker run -it -v $(pwd):/pwn --rm angr/angr
       </code></pre>

       <p>After a while of reading the (very helpful) angr docs and testing things in ipython, it was apparent that angr was not going to have an easy time understanding the call into the shellcode. But it would still be great at crunching out the checksum values! After a few hours I came up with the following.</p>

ANGR Solver Script for hidden_password crackme.

# 14-char password

s = p.factory.entry_state(args=[TARGET, pw])

# ascii printable password
 for byte in pw.chop(8):
     s.solver.add(byte < 0x7f)
     s.solver.add(byte >= 0x20)

# simulation manager with our entry state

sm = p.factory.simulation_manager(s, veritesting=True)

sm.explore(find=0x1511, # right before the shellcode execution
           avoid=[0x1451, 0x14fe, 0x155b, 0x1569]) # invalid password

    l.info(f'Found {len(sm.found)} Potential Solutions...')

else:
    l.info('No Solutions Found...')
       </code></pre>

       <p>The script is pretty simple but there is a lot going on under the hood. Initially I had specified a 30 character password and had veritesting toggled off. Without the veritesting, the script runs indefinitely. </p>

       <p>This is confusing at first, but it is caused by a nearly infinite number of branches being created by the initial loop over the strlen of the input. Since I specified 30 bytes for the password, the length could range from [0-30], and those bytes could range [0-255]</p>
       <p>All of these cases lead to different outcomes, but many of the outcomes are very very similar. Veritesting allows angr to merge branches which are in very similar states. This speeds up the script tremendously.</p>

       <p>If you needed a space heater, you've got one now! So clearly " ,'nnx~!zlr2}1" isn't the solution to the crackme, but it does pass the checksums. So this means that we can load the binary into GDB and read the decoded shellcode!</p>
       <pre><code>
gef$  b *0x555555555542               # call rdx
gef$  r " ,'nnx~!zlr2}1"
gef$  si
gef$  x/50i $rip

       <p>This gives us the following assembly. Note that the first parameter RDI is our password and the second parameter RSI is the length of the password. In order to win, we need to return with RAX = 1. </p>

       <p>Reading through this assembly it becomes clear that it is just a simple XOR with the values loaded onto the stack from <code>0x7fffffffe45c-0x7fffffffe48c</code>. Our password is XORed against one of the size 14 keys and compared to the other one. To reverse this process we can just XOR the two keys together (and fix the endianness).</p>
       <p>This yields the password <code>hello_world_42</code> which is successful against the hidden_password crackme. Thanks to pjenik for the awesome cracking challenge!</p>
       <pre><code>
[michael@pwn ~/Pwn/CrackMes]$ ./hidden_password hello_world_42
Good password!
